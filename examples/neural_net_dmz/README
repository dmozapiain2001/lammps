README for Neural Net Example

These examples run the Ta06 example using the MLIAP package but the potential has been trained using a neural network with a single hidden layer.

1: Running models using LAMMPS executable: in.mliap.snap.Ta06A.

To run this, first run convert_network_2_mliappy.py, which will generate the neural network and populate it with the weights trained for 1000 epochs.

It will be saved as "Ta06A.mliap.pytorch.model.pkl".

It will also copy the "mliappy_pytorch.py" file into the current working directory.

mliappy_pytorch.py contains class definitions suitable for wrapping an arbitrary energy model MLIAPPY. It must be available to python when
creating or unpicking a pytorch model for MLIAPPY.

From that point you can run the example ../../src/lmp -in in.mliap.snap.Ta06A -echo both

You can also run it using LAMMPS in library mode with load_external.py

In order to run this you need to have compiled lammps as a shared library and lammps.py should be avaialable on this directory to enable it to run.
